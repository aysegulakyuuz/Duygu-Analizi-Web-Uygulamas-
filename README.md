# Emotion-Analysis-Web-Application-
ðŸ¤– Artificial Intelligence Module Used
ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective
In this project, a web-based application that analyzes the emotional state (happy, sad, angry, etc.) according to the texts received from the user has been developed. The project performs multi-class emotion analysis on the text and instantly shows the users which emotion the expressions they write carry.


Model: A fine-tuned LLM (e.g. DistilBERT) was used.

Dataset: The model is trained using the GoEmotions dataset.

Output: User-entered text is matched to one or more of 27 different emotion categories.

The model only makes inference.

ðŸ’» Web Application Features
User interface: Simple and user-friendly form (text input)

Input User text

Output: The emotion(s) predicted by the model, displayed visually

Development technologies: For example Flask (backend) + HTML/CSS (frontend) used
